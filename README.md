<h1>Student Information System</h1>

<h2 style="color: #226699;">Introduction</h2>
This simple project was done for one of my friend. This is a simple <b style="color: #229966">JAVA GUI</b> <b>(graphical user interface)</b> program which will allow you to add a student information.
After adding information you can edit and update the information. There are 3 classes used in this simple program . They are Information, Student and Main class.

In Main class the login window is here and a login monitor.png is given. In Information class the harvard-square.png icon is given. Just download the source code and run it with eclipse.
